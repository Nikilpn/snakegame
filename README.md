Snake Game – Python & Pygame
Project Overview

This is a classic Snake game built using Python and Pygame. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, consuming randomly spawned red fruits to grow in size while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen boundaries. The game keeps track of the player's score, features background music, and displays a game-over screen when the player loses.
Features

    Grid-based movement for smooth gameplay.
    Random fruit spawning with increasing difficulty.
    Score tracking system.
    Background music for an immersive experience.
    Game-over screen upon collision.

Gameplay Mechanics

    The snake starts at a fixed position with a single body segment.
    The player can control the snake's movement using arrow keys (← ↑ ↓ →).
    When the snake eats a fruit, it grows longer and the score increases by 10.
    The game ends if:
        The snake collides with itself.
        The snake hits the screen boundaries.

Technologies Used

    Python (for core logic).
    Pygame (for graphics and game loop).
